## Installation

Once hardware is set up, install the system by following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies (list of dependencies here)
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up and use the system

## Python App
1. Open the repository and execute the `main.py` script.
2. Click on "New" to specify the folder for data storage.
3. Select "Set Parameters" to choose the region of interest.
4. Click on "Plot" and "Record" to start recording.

## LabView
1. Create a blank VI by clicking on the block diagram (blank white background without grid), and right-click to open the functions palette: Measurement I/O > Daqmx data acquisition > daq assistant.

   <img src="./images/labview_DAQ_assistant.jpg" alt="LabView Glynnfip" width="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">

2. Choose "Generate Signal" and "Analog Output Voltage" in the DAQ assistant.

   <img src="./images/labview_DAQ_assistant_input.jpg" alt="LabView Glynnfip" width="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">

3. Verify that AO 0 through AO 3 are selected channels.

   <img src="./images/labview_DAQ_channels.jpg" alt="LabView Glynnfip" width="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">

4. Click "OK" and wait for the VI to build (this may take a few seconds).

   <img src="./images/labview_DAQ_ok.jpg" alt="LabView Glynnfip" width="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">

5. Open the `glynnfip.vi` file.

   <img src="./images/labview_Glynnfip.jpg" alt="LabView Glynnfip" width="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">

6. Configure the settings for the `glynnfip.vi`.

   <img src="./images/labview_Glynnfip_setting.jpg" alt="LabView Glynnfip" width="500" style="border: 1px solid black;">

7. Click the "Run" button to start the execution.

## Notation
Before starting each experiment, ensure that you run the Python app first and then the LabView app to synchronize the recording process. 
Before commencing a new experiment (recording), it is important to follow these steps:

1. Stop the `glynnfip.vi` app by clicking the "Stop" button.
2. Set all offsets and amplitudes to 0 in the `glynnfip.vi` app.
3. Run the `glynnfip.vi` app for a short period and then stop it. This aims to reinitialize `glynnfip.vi` to the original state.
4. After reinitializing the `glynnfip.vi` app, set all offsets and amplitudes to 2.5.
5. Start the Python app by following steps 1 to 4 for recording.
6. Click the "Run" button in the `glynnfip.vi` window to begin data acquisition.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Set up the hardware and software according to the instructions in the documentation
2. Design and run your experiment using the system
3. Collect and analyze your data using the provided code and tools
